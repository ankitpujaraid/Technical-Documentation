					What is HTML?
				</header>
				<p>
					HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
				</p>
				<p><b>Hyper Text:</b> HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
					<br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
				</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Markup language:</b> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic.
					<br> It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
				</p>
                <p><b>Web Page:</b> A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type.
					<br><b>With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
					<li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
					<li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
					<li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
					<li>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</li>

					What is CSS
				</header>
				<p>
					CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style 
                    sheet language which is used to describe the look and 
                    formatting of a document written in markup language. 
                    It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally 
                    used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. 
                    It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
				</p>
				<p><b>Use : </b>CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
					<br>
					<b>What does CSS do : </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can add new looks to your old HTML documents.</li>
                        <li>You can completely change the look of your website with only a few changes in CSS code.</li>
                    </ul>
				</p>
                <p><b>Why use CSS : </b>These are the three major benefits of CSS:
					<br>
					<b>1. Solves a big problem</b>
                    Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.

                    <b>2. Saves a lot of time</b>
                    CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.

                    <b>3. Provide more attributes</b>
                    CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.

					JavaScript
				</header>
				<p>
					JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
				</p>
				<p>Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language
				</p>
                <h3>Features of JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    There are following features of JavaScript:
                    <ul>
                        <li>All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).</li>
                        <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.</li>
                        <li>It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.</li>
                        <li>It is a case-sensitive language.
                        </li>
                        <li>JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
